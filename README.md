# Metabase with ClickHouse Driver

Like the title says, this image builds Metabase with the [ClickHouse driver](https://github.com/enqueue/metabase-clickhouse-driver), allowing you to hook up to data that lives in a ClickHouse database.

You can refer to Metabase's [documentation](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/operations-guide/running-metabase-on-docker.html) for tips on running this image.
